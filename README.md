# Kickstarter Analysis 
Data Analysis of Launch Campaign using Excel
Key Queries:
-How many other Kickstarter campaigns were able to meet its fundraising goal in a short amount of time?  
-Does length of the campaign determine its success or failure? 

Outcomes Based on Goals Analysis

	The highest percentage of successful campaign goals were in the range of less than $1000 to $5000. However, the decrease in success rate compared to percentage failed was at $14,999. 
	Beyond $15000 the campaign percentage failure rate started to increase more than the success percentage.
	Recommendation is to focus on projects that are below $15000 since those tend to have a higher success rate.  63% (661 successful below $15,000 / 1047 total projects) of the campaigns were able to meet their fundraising goals. This is a high percentage and significant indicator to identify campaigns at this spend level.

Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	Launch date is a critical factor for the success of the campaign and the length of the campaign is relevant to the success or failure of the campaign.
	There is an uptick in February launch dates that are successful which indicates a good launch date. However, the ideal time frame with the most successful campaign launches in the May and June time period. 
	We recommend campaign launches in the first half of the year and less in the second half of the year.

Limitations of Dataset and Recommendations

	This is a robust dataset but would like to determine if there is a seasonality by location. It would be interesting to determine which location and time of year is ideal to launch a campaign. Adding a map chart with data would help the client visualize where and when to focus resources. Also, adding a pie chart would help with visualizing the data for a non-technical client. 
	Identifying data that shows cost of the campaign to see if these campaigns are profitable. Would be helpful. Success is different for everyone so I would like to determine revenue from each campaign as well by utilizing pie charts and line charts.
